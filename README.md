**Pet project of mushroom classification by using Machine Learning algorithms**

Not really too complicated pet project for the implementation of data preparation and preprocessing and then subsequent classification modeling by using ML algorithms. Data source for this project was UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository with [mushroom dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/848/secondary+mushroom+dataset)
